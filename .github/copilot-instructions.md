# Library Development Guidelines

## Programming Language: TypeScript

**TypeScript Best Practices:**
- Use strict TypeScript configuration with `"strict": true`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for all public functions
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` or proper typing instead
- Use utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial) for type transformations
- Implement proper null/undefined checking

## Framework: Angular

**Angular Development Guidelines:**
- Use Angular CLI for generating components, services, and modules
- Follow Angular style guide conventions
- Implement proper dependency injection patterns
- Use RxJS for reactive programming and state management
- Follow OnPush change detection strategy for performance

## Code Style: Clean Code

**Clean Code Principles:**
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid deep nesting and complex conditional statements
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Write code that tells a story and is easy to understand
- Refactor ruthlessly to eliminate code smells

## Testing: Playwright

**Testing Guidelines:**
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Maintain good test coverage (aim for 80%+ for critical paths)
- Write descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies) appropriately
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints and user flows
- Keep tests fast, isolated, and deterministic

## AI Code Generation Preferences

When generating code, please:

- Generate complete, working code examples with proper imports
- Include inline comments for complex logic and business rules
- Follow the established patterns and conventions in this project
- Suggest improvements and alternative approaches when relevant
- Consider performance, security, and maintainability
- Include error handling and edge case considerations
- Generate appropriate unit tests when creating new functions
- Follow accessibility best practices for UI components
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes when applicable
